## Does Koa replace Express?

  It's more like Connect, but a lot of the Express goodies
  were moved to the middleware level in Koa to help form
  a stronger foundation. This makes middleware more enjoyable
  and less error-prone to write.

## Does Koa replace Connect?

  No, just a different take on similar functionality
  now that generators allow us to write code with less
  callbacks. Connect is equally capable, and some may still prefer it,
  it's up to what you prefer.
